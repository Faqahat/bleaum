					While the initial purpose of this project was to show what a more
					humanized claim flow might look like, some of the opportunities
					identified here have since been assigned to cross-functional teams for
					testing. Since quantifying emotion is a challenge, selling these ideas
					to stakeholders has largely relied on qualitative feedback from
					interviews. In several cases, if we were able to prove that the
					changes didn't impact the business KPIs negatively and we also
					demonstrated positive customer feedback, we were given the green light
					to implement an improvement. In other cases, the emotional improvement
					ended up boosting business KPIs, which made the improvements much
					easier to sell to stakeholders.
